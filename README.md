## Hi there 👋

Welcome to my GitHub repo! If you are like me, then you find data fascinating and do not shy away from a challenge💪🏽 Here are some of the projects I hope to tackle in the near future:

## Basic Data Exploration 🧭🔭
The ETL process is a fascinating one! In the past, I have gathered live data using an API and turned a messy .json file into a fully functional Tableau dashboard! 
I used R to extract and clean the data, then transfer it into a tidy version with multiple pages and custom calculations to help find data insights. Finally, I loaded it into a Tableau Prep Flow and used that 
as the main data source of a dashboard

## Forecasting and Story Telling 🔮
I have always found the ability to predict something before it happens to be an impressive and strong ability! So why not try it out myself! I want to be able to take in past trends in data and 
predict the next BIG thing! 

## Class is in session for this Machine!📚🏫
Using Machine learning to set up data models is both the present and the future. (in my opinion at least) We have these mighty computers, so why not teach them to handle some of our daily tasks? That's going to free up some more time
to do things we really love! Speaking about things we love!

## About me
I have over five years of experience in data analytics, but I still consider myself new. I am always learning, and I like that! If you are content with where you are, then you're not really learning anything! 
When I'm not buried in lines of code or developing a great dashboard, I enjoy being outside or learning to play chess ♖ . Walking to my neighborhood coffee shop ☕️, hitting the gym🏋🏽‍♂️, and lately, I have started camping again! ⛺️ I used to go as a kid with my family all the time
and thats somthing I really miss! 


Well WELCOME! I'm glad you are here! :)
